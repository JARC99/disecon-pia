# PIAE: Development of Convertiplane UAS for First-Necessity Cargo Delivery
This repositiory contains all the developed code for the realization of the capstone project at hand. Although most of the scripts are only applicable to aircraft of similar configurations, it is the hope of the author that at least some of them may be re-used for aeronautical design projects of completely different nature.
